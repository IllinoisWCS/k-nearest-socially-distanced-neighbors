# k-nearest-socially-distanced-neighbors
Workshop repository for the wcs knn workshop. We highly recommend using the colab at https://go.illinoiswcs.org/wcs-meme-knn instead.

To run the notebook, you will need to have python installed. You will also need a package manager such as `pip`. 

Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We recommend using a virtual environment such as conda or venv.
